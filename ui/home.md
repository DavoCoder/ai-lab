# 🧪 AI Lab - Experimentation Guide

Welcome to the AI Lab! This platform is designed for technical users to experiment with various AI concepts and tools. Here's what you can explore:

## 🔍 RAG Pipeline

### What you can do:
- Test different Large Language Models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-3)
- Upload your own documents for knowledge base creation
- Compare different retrieval strategies
- Fine-tune prompt templates

### Limitations:
- Document size limits (typically <2MB per file)
- Rate limits based on API provider
- Processing time for large documents

## 🧬 Embeddings Laboratory

### What you can do:
- Generate embeddings using different models (OpenAI, HuggingFace)
- Visualize document embeddings in 2D/3D space
- Test similarity search
- Compare embedding model performance

### Limitations:
- Local storage constraints for embeddings
- Processing time for large document sets
- Memory requirements for visualization

## 🌐 Web Research Assistant

### What you can do:
- Automate web research tasks
- Extract and summarize content
- Compare different sources

### Limitations:
- Website access restrictions
- Rate limiting from web sources
- HTML parsing limitations

## 🤖 Model Playground

### What you can do:
- Experiment with different AI models
- Compare model outputs
- Test various parameters and settings

### Limitations:
- API costs for commercial models
- Processing time for larger requests
- Model-specific limitations

## ⚙️ Data Processing Hub

### What you can do:
- Clean and preprocess text data
- Convert between different formats
- Extract metadata from documents

### Limitations:
- File size restrictions
- Supported format limitations
- Processing time for batch operations

## 📊 Best Practices

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with small documents/datasets
   - Test with sample data before large-scale processing

2. **Monitor Resources**
   - Keep track of API usage
   - Monitor processing time
   - Check storage usage

3. **Iterative Testing**
   - Compare different models
   - Test various parameters
   - Document your findings

## 🔒 Security Notes

- API keys are securely stored
- Documents are processed locally when possible
- No data is shared with third parties

## 💡 Tips for Getting Started

1. **RAG Pipeline**
   - Start with small PDF documents
   - Test different chunk sizes
   - Compare model responses

2. **Embeddings Lab**
   - Begin with a small set of related documents
   - Observe clustering in visualization
   - Test similarity with known related content

3. **Web Research**
   - Start with specific, focused queries
   - Use rate limiting options
   - Compare different summarization lengths

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser
- Stable internet connection
- API keys for commercial services
