## Overview of App Modes

### 1. Model Playground ü§ñ
An interactive sandbox environment where you can experiment with state-of-the-art language models to generate human-like text, perform text classification for sentiment and topics, identify named entities like people and organizations, create both extractive and abstractive summaries of documents, and translate content between multiple languages while preserving context and technical terminology.

### 2. Web Research Lab üîç
A comprehensive research assistant that automatically crawls and analyzes web content, synthesizes information from multiple sources while resolving contradictions, generates properly formatted citations with credibility scoring, and performs detailed source evaluation including authority assessment and bias detection.

### 3. Data Processing Lab üõ†Ô∏è
A sophisticated text processing pipeline that handles everything from basic cleaning operations like noise removal and character encoding fixes to advanced operations such as semantic document chunking, format conversion with metadata preservation, and automated extraction of document attributes including authors, dates, and topics.

### 4. Knowledge Base Lab üìö
A centralized document management system offering structured storage with version control, automated content categorization and tagging, full-text search capabilities powered by semantic similarity, and flexible organization options including custom taxonomies and cross-referencing between related documents.

### 5. Embeddings Lab üìä
A specialized workspace for creating and managing vector representations of text, featuring multiple embedding model options, interactive visualization tools for exploring semantic relationships, and comprehensive vector database management capabilities including index optimization and performance monitoring.

### 6. RAG Pipeline üîÑ
An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that combines semantic search and context-aware document retrieval, efficient embedding generation with optimized chunking strategies, seamless LLM integration for context injection and response formatting, and configurable pre/post-processing options for quality control and validation.
